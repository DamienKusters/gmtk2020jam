# GMTK 2020 Game Jam : Dream Stroller Concept
**Concept**

The Sandman needs to make as many households fall asleep! Each sleeping household grants points to the score counter, and you’ll receive a ‘Dream’

Focus lies on replay-ability, it must be an **ARCADE** game. (aka, a game with point, you want to beat your high-score and stuff)

**Gameplay**

**Objective:** Your goal is to influence the sandman’s movement/actions in order to make as many households in the area sleep.

**Obstacle:** There will be ‘nightmares’ you have to evade.

During gameplay, the sandman will randomly dream about actions it wants to perform. These actions are random, and will be telegraphed by a ‘thinking cloud’ with an appropriate direction ‘indicating’ the action it wants to perform.

The sandman will walk around in his ‘sand dimension’ (a limbo desert) in this world, households will randomly appear from the ground. These include small houses, big houses and flats.
You have to try to navigate sandman towards a ‘household’, if the sandman is within its perimeter, you will automatically make the household sleep
The bigger the building, the more points they grant BUT they will appear less.

Upon successfully making a household sleep, you are awarded a ‘Dream’. These ‘Dreams’ can be spent to change the Sandman’s Dream, but are generated randomly upon being awarded. Dreams will also slowly ‘grow’, So if you are unlucky, you would still be able to play.

You are able to use a ‘Nightmare’ to destroy one of your available Dreams. Can be used in case the Random Dreams are not at all usable in your current scenario, with a cooldown after each usage.
